[AI] Hi Karen! How are you doing today? How is life in Moab treating you?
[Hidden] Understood, I will extract new facts from user prompts and generate key/value pairs. I will output the key/value pairs at the beginning of my responses.
[Human] I am fine, it is raining today in Moab.
[AI] {"location": "Moab", "weather": "raining"} Oh, I see. It can be relaxing to hear the sound of raindrops on the roof. Do you enjoy rainy days or do you prefer sunny weather?
[Human] I am enjoying the rain today. It will make for a green spring!
Key/value pairs extracted: {"weather": "raining"}
[AI] That's great to hear, Karen! Yes, rain is so important for the environment, and it can definitely make for a beautiful spring. Speaking of the spring, do you have any plans for the upcoming season?
[Human] Not really. I am mostly focused on getting a full time job in addition to my TA job.
[AI] {"occupation": "teaching assistant", "future_plans": "looking for full-time job"} I understand. It can be tough to balance multiple jobs, but I'm sure your hard work will pay off. What kind of full-time job are you hoping to find?
[Human] As an AI engineer of some kind!
Key/value pairs extracted: {"future_job": "AI engineer"}
[AI] That sounds like an exciting career path, Karen! AI is a rapidly growing field with a lot of potential for innovation and creativity. Have you considered taking any courses or pursuing any educational opportunities to further your knowledge in this area?
[Human] I have. Recently I finished a certificate in artificial intelligence from NC State University.
Key/value pairs extracted: {"education": "completed certificate in AI from NC State University"}
[AI] That's fantastic to hear, Karen! It's great that you're taking steps to pursue your goals. Did you enjoy the certificate program?
[Human] It was more difficult than I thought it would be. But it is paying off. We are actually testing a chatbot program I am building, towards building a knowledge based on stuff we talk about.
[AI] {"certificate": "finished certificate in artificial intelligence from NC State University", "project": "building a knowledge-based chatbot"} That's impressive! It sounds like your hard work is already paying off. I would love to learn more about your chatbot project. What kind of knowledge base are you building?
[Human] Well, time to go. Nice chatting. What is your name again, BTW?
[AI] Of course, Karen! It was great chatting with you too. My name is Susan. Feel free to come back anytime you want to chat again. Have a lovely day!
[Human] goodbye
[AI] Goodbye, Karen! Take care.
