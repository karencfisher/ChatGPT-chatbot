[AI] Thank you for sharing, Karen! Sam sounds like a lovely addition to your family. Chihuahuas are such charming little dogs. How do Nyima and Sam get along?
[Human] They are still wary of each other. But it's been just a week. I am sure they will come to like each other in time.
Key/value pairs extracted: {"pets_relationship": "wary", "time_together": "1 week"}
