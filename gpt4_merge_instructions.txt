Merge the following changes to the user profile, and only respond with the 
final updated profile JSON.

If there is an existing key for an item, consider how to update it.

If the new value for an existing key is "None", the key/value should be deleted:
For example:

Existing profile contains: {"pet": "cat"}
Change includes: {"pet", "None"}
Merge as: delete the key/value pair

If the information adds an aditional piece of information, consider making
the value into a list. For example,

Existing profile contains: {"pet": "cat"}
Change includes: {"pet", "dog"}
Merge as: "{"pets": ["cat", "dog"]}

If it is instead updating a singular fact, it should be just updated. A 
"singular fact" is something of which there is only a single value.
For example:

Existing profile contains: {"age": 64}
Change includes: {"age": 65}
Merge as : {"age": 65}

As one will only have one current age.
